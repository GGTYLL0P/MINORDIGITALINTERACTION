It follows a mix of present-day soldiers and civilians sent into the future to fight and stop an evil alien army.
                 Originally set for theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Amazon Studios due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and digitally released on July 2, 2021, via Prime Video. With a budget of US$200 million, the film was one of the most expensive films to debut on a streaming platform. The Tomorrow War received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the concept, action sequences, and performances (particularly Pratt and Richardson), but criticism for its derivative execution. A sequel is in development."
