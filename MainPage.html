                 data-description="The Tomorrow War is a 2021 American military science-fiction action film directed by Chris McKay, written by Zach Dean, and starring Chris Pratt. It was produced by David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Don Granger, David S. Goyer, Jules Daly, and Adam Kolbrenner, with a supporting cast featuring Yvonne Strahovski, J. K. Simmons, Betty Gilpin, Sam Richardson, Edwin Hodge, Jasmine Mathews, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, and Keith Powers. It follows a mix of present-day soldiers and civilians sent into the future to fight and stop an evil alien army.
                 Originally set for theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Amazon Studios due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and digitally released on July 2, 2021, via Prime Video. With a budget of US$200 million, the film was one of the most expensive films to debut on a streaming platform. The Tomorrow War received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the concept, action sequences, and performances (particularly Pratt and Richardson), but criticism for its derivative execution. A sequel is in development."

The film stars Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Ed Harris, and Andy García. It follows a satellite designer who tries to save the world from a storm of epic proportions caused by malfunctioning climate-controlling satellites.
                Principal photography began on October 20, 2014, in New Orleans, Louisiana. After poor test screenings, reshoots took place in December 2016 under executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writer Laeta Kalogridis, and new director Danny Cannon. To date, the film is the only co-production between Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Pictures.
                 Geostorm was released in the United States on October 20, 2017, in all formats, and heavily underperformed at the box office, grossing only $221.6 million worldwide against a $120–130 million budget, losing Warner Bros. $71.6 million. The film was also widely well received by critics."
